For ESP8266 I use modified code from seb821/espRFLinkMQTT (https://github.com/seb821/espRFLinkMQTT). Thanx for it!)
File espnrf1.bin compiled in arduino IDE for 1M memory and tested on esp-01. File espnrf4.bin compiled for 4M memory. 
If you need to recompile you need to download and install in arduino IDE 2 additional libraries: Asynchronous MQTT client 
(https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client) and  Async TCP Library for ESP8266 (https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP)
Download Zip files from this links then in the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add . ZIP Library. At the
top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add . ZIP Library". Both ArduinoJson and PubSubClient libraries not needed
for compile. 
After flashing you need open wifi AP(SSID:"espnrfwifi", Password: "espnrfwifi"). Esp connects to this AP then you may set all
wifi and mqtt parameters. For second gateway you need to replace NRFID Number from 1 to 2 and change  RRFID from 0 to 1 and
RFCH in file NRFSVR00.a51 and recompile nrf.
nrf1 - RRFID 0, nrf2 - RRFID 1, .... nrf9 - RRFID 8.
