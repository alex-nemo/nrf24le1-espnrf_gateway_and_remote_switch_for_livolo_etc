For ESP8266 I use modified code from seb821/espRFLinkMQTT 
(https://github.com/seb821/espRFLinkMQTT). Thanx for it!)
File espnrf.bin compiled in arduino and tested on esp-01.
After flashing you need open wifi AP(SSID:"espnrfwifi",
Password: "espnrfwifi"). Esp connects to this AP then you
may set all wifi and mqtt parameters.
For second gateway you need to replace NRFID Number from
1 to 2 and change  RRFID from 0 to 1 and RFCH in file
NRFSVR00.a51 and recompile nrf.
nrf1 - RRFID 0, nrf2 - RRFID 1, .... nrf9 - RRFID 8.
